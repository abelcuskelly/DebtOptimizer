# This is a placeholder PNG file for social media previews
# To create a proper PNG, you can:
# 1. Use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to convert the SVG
# 2. Use an online SVG to PNG converter
# 3. Take a screenshot of the SVG in a browser
# 4. Use design tools like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop

# The SVG files work for most modern platforms, but some may prefer PNG
# For now, the SVG versions should work for social media previews
